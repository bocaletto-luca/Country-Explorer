## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Country Explorer runs in modern web browsers and does not require additional dependencies. For development purposes, it is recommended to use a code editor with live reload functionality (such as Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/country-explorer.git cd country-explorer

2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, use a live reload server via your code editor to preview changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application uses JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve country data from free public APIs (like the REST Countries API). The JSON response is parsed to create dynamic and informative country cards.
- **Filtering by Continent:** Users can sort and filter countries by selecting a specific continent, which updates the displayed results accordingly.
- **Country Details Display:** Each country card shows key details including the country's name, flag, capital city, region, and population.
- **Interactive Population Charts:** Leveraging Chart.js, the app renders interactive charts that visually represent population data, helping users gain insights into demographic trends.
- **Responsive UI:** With Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS, Country Explorer adapts seamlessly to any device, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience.
